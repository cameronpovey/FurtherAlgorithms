# TASK 1.1
Output file has been included for proof of work

# TASK 1.3
coresforwholetext.py - Each core takes a seperate bit of text
count.py - Each core takes a seperate name and searches the whole text

coresforwholetext.py is much more efficient - cores.py is here just for comparison

# TASK 1.4
Using Dijkstras - routefinder.py - I think Dijkstras algorithm is the better one for most purposes
Using BFS - route-withBFS.py
Dijkstras - Testing: 73 to 84 - results: lines 99 to 130
BFS - Testing: line 66 to 77 - results: lines 91 to 104
